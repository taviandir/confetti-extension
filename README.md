# CONfetti - Make CON great again!

This is the source code for the browser extension CONfetti.

## Disclaimer

This script in no ways alters data, does not intercept data sent to or from the CON servers. It merely tweaks the UI in various ways, by modifying the HTML in the browser.


# Why

CONfetti enhances the UI experience in Conflict Of Nations. I created this extension to add functionality that I and others think should already exist.


# Features

- Revamped Events window
  - Highlight unread events
  - Filter by type
  - Filter by country
  - "Research Completed" specifies unit type (when not ambiguous)
  - Clearer Agent missions outcomes (partially done)
- Take notes (per game, saved in the browser)
- Window showing Units by Building Level
- Hide tutorial advisor in the top-right
- Messages: CTRL-Enter to send message


# Known issues

- CTRL-Enter to send messages only works sometimes


# Upcoming features / Wishlist / Ideas

-   Events:
    -   Agent missions clarification (in progress)
    -   Freetext search
    -   More detailed combat filters (ground / naval / air / missiles, wins / losses)
    -   Combat clarification (directions, e.g. I attacked X, or X attacked me - if possible)
-   Show city morale details right away (if possible)
-   Advanced Combat Report window
-   Units By B-Level - officers, seasonal as optional includes
-   Game Selector View: Force English language (so the extension works properly)
